## Overview

JSON Web Keys (JWKs) are used by OAuth 2.0 client applications to authenticate with Okta using the `private_key_jwt` client authentication method.
This is an asymmetric authentication mechanism where the application possesses a private key and Okta stores the corresponding public key.
A service application can have multiple JWKs configured for key rotation purposes.

JWKs are represented as `Okta_JWK` nodes in BloodHound.
