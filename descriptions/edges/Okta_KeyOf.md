## General Information

The traversable `Okta_KeyOf` edges represent the relationships between applications ([Okta_Application](../Nodes/Okta_Application.md)) and their JWKs:

```mermaid
graph LR
    app1("Okta_Application OktaHound Collector")
    app2("Okta_Application Security Scanner")
    key1("Okta_JWK ABC123")
    key2("Okta_JWK DEF456")
    key3("Okta_JWK GHI789")
    key1 -- Okta_KeyOf --> app1
    key2 -- Okta_KeyOf --> app2
    key3 -- Okta_KeyOf --> app2
```

Possession of the private key corresponding to a JWK allows an attacker to authenticate as the application. The `Okta_KeyOf` edge can be used in BloodHound to understand which applications use JWK-based authentication and trace potential attack paths involving compromised private keys.
