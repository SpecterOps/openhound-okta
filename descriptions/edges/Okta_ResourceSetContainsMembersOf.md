## General Information

The non-traversable Okta_ResourceSetContainsMembersOf edges represent resource sets that contain the members of a group in Okta, as opposed to the group object itself:

```mermaid
graph LR
    rs1("Okta_ResourceSet Frontline Workers")
    g1("Okta_Group Retail Staff")
    u1("Okta_User john\@contoso.com")
    u2("Okta_User bob\@contoso.com")
    rs1 -. Okta_ResourceSetContainsMembersOf .-> g1
    u1 -- Okta_MemberOf --> g1
    u2 -- Okta_MemberOf --> g1
    rs1 -. Okta_ResourceSetContainsIndirect .-> u1
    rs1 -. Okta_ResourceSetContainsIndirect .-> u2
```

In the Okta Admin Console, this corresponds to adding a group to a resource set with the *Users in group* option instead of *Group*.

A custom role scoped to the resource set applies to the users who are members of the group, not to the group itself. For example, a Help Desk role scoped to this resource set can reset passwords of the group's members but cannot manage the group's membership. The individual users in scope are represented by the [Okta_ResourceSetContainsIndirect](Okta_ResourceSetContainsIndirect.md) edges, while directly contained objects are represented by the [Okta_ResourceSetContains](Okta_ResourceSetContains.md) edges.
